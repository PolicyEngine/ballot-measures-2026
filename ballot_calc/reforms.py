"""Reform definition for the Colorado Initiative 195 (Amendment 87) dashboard.

Colorado Initiative 195 (ballot designation "Amendment 87", November
2026 ballot) replaces Colorado's 4.4% flat income tax with a six-bracket
graduated schedule on Colorado taxable income, uniform across filing
statuses, effective for taxable years commencing on or after
January 1, 2027.

The reform is modeled in policyengine-us as a contributed parameter
(PR #9431, first released in 1.825.0): setting
``gov.contrib.states.co.progressive_income_tax.in_effect`` to true
switches ``co_income_tax_before_non_refundable_credits`` from the flat
rate to the graduated schedule.

Direction is FORWARD: baseline = current law (flat 4.4%), reform =
Initiative 195 graduated schedule. Everywhere in this repository,
``impact = reform - baseline`` (a negative net-income change means the
household pays more tax under the initiative).
