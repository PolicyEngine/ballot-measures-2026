"""Pre-compute representative Colorado households for the household tab.

For each profile, runs a current-law (flat 4.4%) simulation and an
Initiative 195 (graduated schedule) simulation at the profile's income
point, plus an employment-income sweep from $0 to $1,300,000 so the
chart shows all six brackets -- including the 8.4% bracket above $1M.

Direction and signs follow scripts/DATA_SCHEMA.md:

- ``net_income_change`` = reform - baseline household net income
  (negative = the household pays more tax under Initiative 195).
- ``state_tax_change`` / ``federal_tax_change`` are tax-side:
  reform - baseline tax (positive = pays more tax).

There is no per-provision attribution: Initiative 195 is a single
provision (one contrib flag), so the GA template's ``provisions`` /
``provisions_chart`` keys are intentionally gone.

Runs locally (no Modal):
