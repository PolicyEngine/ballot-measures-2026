            The microdata&apos;s Colorado income distribution matches IRS SOI
            actuals on filer counts at high incomes — it carries 184% of
            SOI&apos;s count of returns with AGI over $1 million — but
            truncates income per filer: mean AGI in the $1M+ band is $1.27
            million in the model vs. $3.03 million in SOI (tax year 2023).
            Income mass above the $1 million threshold, which the top 8.4%
            bracket taxes, is $7.8 billion in the model vs. $31.7 billion in
            SOI — 24% coverage.

          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Scaling the model&apos;s upper-bracket revenue by the SOI
            coverage ratio yields approximately $1.9 billion, within 5% of
            the LCS annualized estimate.

          <strong>Scope and baseline differences.</strong> The LCS estimate

          outside this household model&apos;s scope — and LCS publishes no
          individual/corporate split. Additional smaller differences: the
          LCS baseline excludes 2025 H.R. 1 (the &quot;One Big Beautiful
          Bill Act&quot;), which this model&apos;s baseline includes; the

              to break the circularity between Colorado taxable income and
              federal itemized deductions, so Initiative 195&apos;s rate
              changes do not feed back into federal tax. If modeled, the net
              federal effect would likely be small (on the order of 1&ndash;2%
              of the state revenue change) and would modestly increase
              federal revenue: filers above $500,000 are already at the
              phased-down SALT cap, while itemizers below $500,000 would
              deduct up to $325 less.
